This topic explains how RabbitMQ for PCF operators can comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
For more information about data protection in PCF, see [GDPR Compliance](https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/security/gdpr.html).
For more information about data protection in the RabbitMQ server, see [Link to RabbitMQ GDPR docs].

## <a id="queues"></a> Personal Data in RabbitMQ for PCF

Pivotal recommends that you strictly control personally identifiable information 
used to interact with RabbitMQ for PCF. 
This information might be stored in the following locations:

* [Queues](#queues)
* [Logs](#logs)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: 
	For a list of the locations that personal data might be stored throughout PCF, see

		Understanding Personal Data in PCF</a></p>

## <a id="queues"></a> Queues

RabbitMQ for PCF does not know if any message contains personally identifiable information. 
If you use RabbitMQ for PCF to send personally identifiable information, 
you should take appropriate safeguards to protect that information.

### <a id="messages"></a> Stored Messages

RabbitMQ stores messages, including message headers, in memory and on disk until they are consumed.
The following are actions you can take to comply with the GDPR:

* Monitor your queues to ensure that messages are being consumed in a timely manner, 
and the lifecycle of messages containing personally identifiable information is managed according to your data protection policies.
* Consider using non-durable messages and setting a time to live (TTL) to limit the lifespan of messages.  

### <a id="security"></a> Controlling Access

You should also control access to your RabbitMQ servers, RabbitMQ management commands, and the management console.

## <a id="logs"></a> Logs

### <a id="haproxy-logs"></a> HAProxy Logs

RabbitMQ for PCF uses HAProxy as a load balancer for the pre-provisioned service.
The log may contain IP addresses.
These are contained in the file `/var/vcap/sys/log/rabbitmq-haproxy/haproxy.log` on an haproxy VM.

To empty the contents of an haproxy log, run the command:

```
/var/vcap/sys/log/rabbitmq-haproxy/haproxy.log
```

### <a id="server-logs"></a> RabbitMQ Server Logs

The RabbitMQ server logs may contain IP addresses.
The log files are stored on rabbitmq-server VMs in the directory `/var/vcap/sys/log/rabbitmq-server`.
For information about RabbitMQ server logs, see [Logging](https://www.rabbitmq.com/logging.html) in the RabbitMQ documentation.
