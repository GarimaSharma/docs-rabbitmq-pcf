This topic provides instructions to PCF operators about how to install, configure, and deploy the RabbitMQ for PCF tile to provide 
a pre-provisioned service. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For instructions on how to install, configure, and deploy the RabbitMQ for PCF tile 
as an on-demand service, see <a href="./install-config.html">
Installing and Configuring RabbitMQ for PCF as an On-Demand Service</a>.</p>

## <a id="install"></a> Download and Install the Tile

1. Download the product file from Pivotal Network.

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

3. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of RabbitMQ for PCF. This adds the tile to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added **RabbitMQ for PCF** tile.

### <a id='dash'></a>Management Dashboard

You must choose an admin username and password for RabbitMQ.

This will grant you full admin access to RabbitMQ through the Management UI.

<%= image_tag("images/config_credentials.jpeg") %>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To rotate your administrator credentials, enter a new username and password, save your options, and redeploy by returning to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and clicking <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</p>

### <a id='ha-cluster'></a>Plugins

You can choose which plugins you wish to enable.

You must leave the management plugin enabled otherwise nothing will work.

<%= image_tag("images/config_plugins.jpeg") %>

### <a id="haproxy"></a>HAProxy Ports

You can choose which ports HAProxy should load balance to the RabbitMQ nodes.

<%= image_tag("images/config_haproxy.jpeg") %>

By default, all the default ports of all the available plugins will be load-balanced.

However, if you install extra protocol plugins, or provide a custom configuration which changes the ports that RabbitMQ listens on then you must update the list of load-balanced ports.

Note that you must always leave the management plugin listening on port `15672` and load balance that port.

If you change the topology of your RabbitMQ cluster, the HAProxy is automatically reconfigured during the deployment.

### <a id='ha-cluster'></a>Connecting to a Highly Available RabbitMQ Cluster

The latest version of RabbitMQ tile 1.5.*, allows for a highly available cluster through multiple HAProxy nodes. The `hostnames`, `uris` and `hosts` properties have been added and should be used in preference over the equivalent singular properties. The singular properties are maintained for backwards compatibility and will always contain the first value from the equivalent plural property. The singular properties will eventually be deprecated.

For example with two HAProxy jobs deployed the following properties will be present:
<pre><code>"hostname": "10.0.0.41",
"hostnames": [
    "10.0.0.41",
    "10.0.0.51"]
</code></pre>

### <a id='port-map'></a>Port to protocol mappings

* 15672 = Management dashboard
* 5672 = RabbitMQ
* 5671 = RabbitMQ SSL
* 1883 = MQTT
* 8883 = MQTT SSL
* 61613 = STOMP
* 61614 = STOMP SSL
* 15674 = Web STOMP
* 4567 = RabbitMQ Service Broker
* 3457 - 3459 = CF Loggregator

### <a id='sec-groups'></a>Security Groups

To enable access to the RabbitMQ tile service, you must ensure your security
group allows access to the HAProxy and RabbitMQ Service Broker VMs configured in your deployment. You can obtain the IP addresses for these from the Ops Manager **Status** page for the RabbitMQ tile.
Ensure the following ports are enabled for those VMs:

* 15672
* 5672
* 5671
* 1883
* 8883
* 61613
* 61614
* 15674
* 4567
* 3457 - 3459

The following is a template for configuring your Cloud Foundry security groups:
```
[
{"protocol":"tcp","destination":"<haproxy-node-IP-addresses>","ports":"5671,5672,1883,8883,61613,61614,15672,15674"},
{"protocol":"tcp","destination":"<service-broker-node-IP-addresses>","ports":"4567"}
]
```

### <a id="asg"></a>Application Security Groups

To allow this service to have network access you must create
[Application Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) (ASGs).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The service is unusable without Application Security Groups.</p>

### Application Container Network Connections

Application containers that use instances of the RabbitMQ service require the following outbound network connections:

|Destination        |Ports       |Protocol   |Reason
|---                |---         |---        |---
|`HAProxy IPs`     |5672         |tcp        |Application containers using AMQP
|`HAProxy IPs`     |5671       |tcp        |Application containers using AMQP over SSL
|`HAProxy IPs`     |1883         |tcp        |Application containers using MQTT
|`HAProxy IPs`     |8883        |tcp        |Application containers using MQTT over SSL
|`HAProxy IPs`     |61613         |tcp        |Application containers using STOMP
|`HAProxy IPs`     |61614        |tcp        |Application containers using STOMP over SSL
|`HAProxy IPs`     |61613         |tcp        |Application containers using Web STOMP

Create an ASG name `rabbitmq-app-containers` with the above configuration and bind it to the appropriate space, or, to provide access to all started apps, bind it to the `default-running` ASG set and restart your apps. If you are using an external load balancer or have more than one IP address for HAProxy, you must also create egress rules for these. Example:

```
[
  {
      "ports": "5671-5672",
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "destination": "10.10.10.10/32"
  }
]
```

## <a id="ssl"></a> SSL

You can provide SSL certificates and keys for use by the RabbitMQ cluster.

<%= image_tag("images/config_ssl.jpeg") %>

SSL is simultaneously provided on the AMQPS port (5671) and the management port (15672).

If you provide SSL keys and certificates, you disable non-SSL support.

No other plugins are automatically configured for use with SSL.

SSL settings are applied equally across all machines in the cluster.

For more information about SSL support, see [https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html).

### <a id="erlang"></a>Erlang Cookie

You can provide an Erlang cookie to be used by the cluster.
This can be useful if you want to connect directly to the RabbitMQ cluster, such as with `rabbitmqctl`, or to connect other machines running Erlang.

<%= image_tag("images/config_erlang.jpeg") %>

### <a id="config"></a>RabbitMQ Config

You can provide a full <code>rabbitmq.config</code> file, if you wish.

<%= image_tag("images/config_rabbitmq.jpeg") %>

This file is then provided to all the nodes in the cluster.

For more information about the RabbitMQ configuration, see [https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html).

### <a id="tls"></a>TLS Support

TLS v1.0 is disabled by default, due to insecurities.

<%= image_tag("images/config_tls1.jpeg") %>

You can enable it again by selecting the checkbox.

TLS v1.1 and 1.2 are enabled by default and cannot be turned on or off.

## External load balancer
<%= image_tag("images/config_elb.jpeg") %>

You can configure a DNS name or IP address of an external load balancer to be returned in the binding credentials (`VCAP_SERVICES`) to application developers.

### <a id="static_ips"></a> Static IPs

#### Switching from dynamic IPs to static IPs (Upgrading)

It is not possible to switch from dynamic IPs to a different set of static IPs, but you can
set up Ops Manager so the current set of dynamically assigned IPs will always continue to be used.

1. Go to the Status page on the RabbitMQ product.
2. Note the IPs for the RabbitMQ Server and HAProxy for RabbitMQ jobs, in the order nodes appear in the UI.
3. Go to the Settings tab, and navigate to the Networking page.
4. Fill the IP addresses you got from the Status page. IP addresses should be in a comma-separated list.

<%= image_tag("images/config_static_ip.png") %>

## RabbitMQ Server settings that cannot be overwritten
* `rabbit halt_on_upgrade_failure false`
* `rabbitmq_mqtt subscription_ttl 1800000`
* `log_levels [{connection,info}]`
* `halt_on_upgrade_failure false`
* `{rabbit, [ {collect_statistics_interval, 60000}] }`
* `{rabbitmq_management, [ {rates_mode, none}] }`

When SSL is enabled:

* `rabbit tcp_listeners []`
* `rabbit ssl_listeners [5671]`
* `rabbitmq_management listener [{port,15672},{ssl,false}]`
* `rabbitmq_mqtt ssl_listeners [8883]`
* `rabbitmq_stomp ssl_listeners [61614]`

<%= image_tag("images/metrics_polling.png") %>

#### Disk free alarm limit

<%= image_tag("images/disk_alarm_threshold.png") %>

Selecting *50MB* is not recommended and could cause data loss because it warns
too late in case of not enough disk to let RabbitMQ page memory to the
persistent disk. That option enables customers to transition from environments
where this was the default.


## <a id="apply-changes"></a>Apply Configuration and Complete the Installation

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install RabbitMQ for PCF tile.

2. **Q:** How does one follow the progress of the tile, what to check? how long does it take?
