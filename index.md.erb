RabbitMQ is a fast and dependable open-source message server that supports a wide range of use cases including reliable integration, content based routing and global data delivery, and high volume monitoring and data ingestion.

Emerging as the defacto standard for cloud messaging, RabbitMQ is used for efficient communication between servers, applications and devices, and creates lasting value by enabling rapid development of modern decentralized application and data architectures that can scale with your business needs.
The Pivotal CF installer enables cloud operators to deploy a RabbitMQ service in Pivotal CF. You can deploy the service as a single node or a cluster.

## Features

* Provision an instance of the RabbitMQ service, which corresponds to a unique RabbitMQ vhost (virtual host)
* Bind applications to an instance of the plan, providing unique credentials for each binding
* Management dashboard access to PCF Operators and application developers
* Deployment across multiple availability zones, with nodes striped across the AZs automatically
* Enable SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for the AMQP, MQTT, STOMP protocols
* 2 node RabbitMQ cluster in a default deployment
* HAProxy load balancer across all nodes to balance connections
* Plugin configuration can be easily changed at any time and the cluster redeployed and updated
* The cluster topology can be changed and easily scaled out

### Using RabbitMQ in your application

RabbitMQ is shown in the services marketplace, either in the developer console or through `cf marketplace` on the CLI.

Application developers can create an instance of the application with `cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard <your name>`.
For this service an instance equals a **Vhost** on the RabbitMQ cluster.

Creating a binding gives the user permissions to access this Vhost and associated management dashboard.
