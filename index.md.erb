RabbitMQ is a fast and dependable open-source message server that supports a wide range of use cases including reliable integration, content based routing and global data delivery, and high volume monitoring and data ingestion.

Emerging as the defacto standard for cloud messaging, RabbitMQ is used for efficient communication between servers, applications and devices, and creates lasting value by enabling rapid development of modern decentralized application and data architectures that can scale with your business needs.
The [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installer enables cloud operators to deploy a [RabbitMQ service](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service) in PCF. You can deploy the service as a single node or a cluster.

### Install via Pivotal Ops Manager

To install RabbitMQ for PCF, follow the procedure for installing Pivotal Ops Manager tiles:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).
1. Upload the product file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the Ops Manager `Available Products` view to add this product to your staging area.
1. Click the newly added tile to review any configurable options.
1. Click **Apply Changes** to install the service.

This product requires Ops Manager version 1.4.0 or greater.

### Using RabbitMQ in your application

RabbitMQ is shown in the services marketplace, either in the developer console or through `cf marketplace` on the CLI.

Application developers can create an instance of the application with `cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard <your name>`.
For this service an instance equals a **Vhost** on the RabbitMQ cluster.

Creating a binding gives the user permissions to access this Vhost and associated management dashboard.
