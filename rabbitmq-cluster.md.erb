title: Accessing the RabbitMQ Cluster Directly

If you wish to run commands such as <code>rabbitmqctl</code> then you have two options:

* SSH into one of the machines running the rabbitmq-server. IPs can be found from the Status tab and access credentials from the Credentials tab within the RabbitMQ component of the installer. From there you need to bring RabbitMQ and Erlang into your environment and from there you can use <code>rabbitmqctl</code>:

<pre><code>bash-4.1# . /var/vcap/packages/erlang/enable; . /var/vcap/packages/rabbitmq-server/enable
bash-4.1# rabbitmqctl cluster_status
Cluster status of node rabbit@node0 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@node0,rabbit@node1,rabbit@node2,rabbit@node3]}]},
 {running_nodes,[rabbit@node3,rabbit@node2,rabbit@node1,rabbit@node0]},
 {partitions,[]}]
...done.</code></pre>

* Alternatively install RabbitMQ and Erlang on a machine of your choice (though be sure to match versions of both to the cluster: the Management UI shows both the version of RabbitMQ and Erlang). Then set your <code>~/.erlang.cookie</code> to match the cookie used in the cluster (you may have supplied this as part of the installation; see above). The nodes in the cluster are always named numerically from node0 upwards. You'll need to set up your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file so that node0 is the first IP of your cluster of Rabbits and so on.
