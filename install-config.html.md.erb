This topic provides instructions to PCF operators about how to install, configure, and deploy the RabbitMQ for PCF tile to provide on-demand service. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For instructions on how to install, configure, and deploy the RabbitMQ for PCF tile, see
<a href="http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/rabbitmq-cf-d34379b0-a290-47c7-bc6c-c45a9adfa8c7/index.html">the documentation for
pre-provisioned RabbitMQ for PCF</a>.</p>

## <a id="install"></a> Download and Install the Tile

1. Download the product file from Pivotal Network.

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

3. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of RabbitMQ for PCF. This adds the tile to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added **RabbitMQ for PCF** tile.

## <a id="config-on-demand"></a>  Configure the Tile for On-Demand Service

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
    <p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: You cannot change the regions or networks after you have clicked **Apply Changes** in the <a href="#apply-changes">final step</a> below.</p>

2. Configure the fields on the **Assign AZs and Networks** as follows:
  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the region that you want for singleton VMs. PCF creates the RabbitMQ broker in this availability zone (AZ).</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select additional region. This selection does not affect the on-demand RabbitMQ for PCF service.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select a subnet for the RabbitMQ broker.<br>
            This network is represented by the Default Network in this <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/on-demand-service-broker/0-14/about.html">picture</a>.
            Typically, you select the subnet used for the Pivotal Elastic Runtime components.
            <strong>Q:</strong> Who sets up this subnet? Should I use the same subnet as for my ERT components? Do we need to specify that it cannot be an IPsec subnet?
            <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/1-7/">https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/1-7/</a>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
        <td> This is the subnet that the on-demand service instances are on. 
             A typical practice is to put all on-demand services on a single subnet. (?) 
             This network is represented by the Services Network in this <a herf="https://docs.pivotal.io/on-demand-service-broker/0-14/about.html">picture</a>. 
             If you are not using on-demand services but only classic services, you need to specify a subnet but which subnet you specify does not matter.</td></tr>
  </table>

3. Click **Save**.

4. Click **RabbitMQ**.

5. Enter **RabbitMQ admin user credentials**.<br>
   These credentials are not used by the on-demand RabbitMQ for PCF service but the fields cannot be blank.
   You do not need to make any other edits to this page.

6. Click **Save**.

7. If you want to set up monitoring, click **Syslog**, complete the fields, and save.<br>
   For more information, see [Monitoring RabbitMQ for PCF](./monitor.html).

7. Click **Dedicated Instance: Single Node Plan**. 

8. Configure the fields on the **Dedicated Instance: Single Node Plan** as follows:
  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable this plan</strong></strong></td>
        <td>Select the checkbox.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Marketplace name</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter a name.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan name</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter a name.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan description</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter a description.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan features</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter information about the plan to help your app developers.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Service instance quota</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the maximum number of dedicated service instances that can be available at one time.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>RabbitMQ VM Type</strong></td>
        <td>Select a large VM type.<br>The plan will create a service instance of this size.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Persistent disk type</strong></td>
        <td>Select a disk 5&nbsp;GB or 10&nbsp;GB in size.<br>This disk will store the RabbitMQ messages.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>AZ placement</strong></td>
        <td>Select one AZ for the single node.<br>The plan will create all the on-demand service instance VMs in this AZ.</td></tr>
  </table>
    
9. Click **Save**.

10. Click **Stemcell**.

11. Verify and, if necessary, import a new stemcell version.  
    For more information, see the information about importing the stemcell for your IaaS:

## <a id="config-pre-provisioned"></a>Configure the Tile for On-Demand Service

### <a id='dash'></a>Management Dashboard

You must choose an admin username and password for RabbitMQ.

This will grant you full admin access to RabbitMQ through the Management UI.

<%= image_tag("images/config_credentials.jpeg") %>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To rotate your administrator credentials, enter a new username and password, save your options, and redeploy by returning to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and clicking <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</p>

### <a id='ha-cluster'></a>Plugins

You can choose which plugins you wish to enable.

You must leave the management plugin enabled otherwise nothing will work.

<%= image_tag("images/config_plugins.jpeg") %>

[Click here for more information about RabbitMQ plugins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html)

### <a id="haproxy"></a>HAProxy Ports

You can choose which ports HAProxy should load balance to the RabbitMQ nodes.

<%= image_tag("images/config_haproxy.jpeg") %>

By default, all the default ports of all the available plugins will be load-balanced.

However, if you install extra protocol plugins, or provide a custom configuration which changes the ports that RabbitMQ listens on then you must update the list of load-balanced ports.

Note that you must always leave the management plugin listening on port `15672` and load balance that port.

If you change the topology of your RabbitMQ cluster, the HAProxy is automatically reconfigured during the deployment.

### <a id='ha-cluster'></a>Connecting to a Highly Available RabbitMQ Cluster

The latest version of RabbitMQ tile 1.5.*, allows for a highly available cluster through multiple HAProxy nodes. The `hostnames`, `uris` and `hosts` properties have been added and should be used in preference over the equivalent singular properties. The singular properties are maintained for backwards compatibility and will always contain the first value from the equivalent plural property. The singular properties will eventually be deprecated.

For example with two HAProxy jobs deployed the following properties will be present:
<pre><code>"hostname": "10.0.0.41",
"hostnames": [
    "10.0.0.41",
    "10.0.0.51"]
</code></pre>

### <a id='port-map'></a>Port to protocol mappings

* 15672 = Management dashboard
* 5672 = RabbitMQ
* 5671 = RabbitMQ SSL
* 1883 = MQTT
* 8883 = MQTT SSL
* 61613 = STOMP
* 61614 = STOMP SSL
* 15674 = Web STOMP
* 4567 = RabbitMQ Service Broker
* 3457 - 3459 = CF Loggregator

### <a id='sec-groups'></a>Security Groups

To enable access to the RabbitMQ tile service, you must ensure your security
group allows access to the HAProxy and RabbitMQ Service Broker VMs configured in your deployment. You can obtain the IP addresses for these from the Ops Manager **Status** page for the RabbitMQ tile.
Ensure the following ports are enabled for those VMs:

* 15672
* 5672
* 5671
* 1883
* 8883
* 61613
* 61614
* 15674
* 4567
* 3457 - 3459

The following is a template for configuring your Cloud Foundry security groups:
```
[
{"protocol":"tcp","destination":"<haproxy-node-IP-addresses>","ports":"5671,5672,1883,8883,61613,61614,15672,15674"},
{"protocol":"tcp","destination":"<service-broker-node-IP-addresses>","ports":"4567"}
]
```

### <a id="asg"></a>Application Security Groups

To allow this service to have network access you must create
[Application Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) (ASGs).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The service is unusable without Application Security Groups.</p>

### Application Container Network Connections

Application containers that use instances of the RabbitMQ service require the following outbound network connections:

|Destination        |Ports       |Protocol   |Reason
|---                |---         |---        |---
|`HAProxy IPs`     |5672         |tcp        |Application containers using AMQP
|`HAProxy IPs`     |5671       |tcp        |Application containers using AMQP over SSL
|`HAProxy IPs`     |1883         |tcp        |Application containers using MQTT
|`HAProxy IPs`     |8883        |tcp        |Application containers using MQTT over SSL
|`HAProxy IPs`     |61613         |tcp        |Application containers using STOMP
|`HAProxy IPs`     |61614        |tcp        |Application containers using STOMP over SSL
|`HAProxy IPs`     |61613         |tcp        |Application containers using Web STOMP

Create an ASG name `rabbitmq-app-containers` with the above configuration and bind it to the appropriate space, or, to provide access to all started apps, bind it to the `default-running` ASG set and restart your apps. If you are using an external load balancer or have more than one IP address for HAProxy, you must also create egress rules for these. Example:

```
[
  {
      "ports": "5671-5672",
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "destination": "10.10.10.10/32"
  }
]
```

## <a id="ssl"></a> SSL

You can provide SSL certificates and keys for use by the RabbitMQ cluster.

<%= image_tag("images/config_ssl.jpeg") %>

SSL is simultaneously provided on the AMQPS port (5671) and the management port (15672).

If you provide SSL keys and certificates, you disable non-SSL support.

No other plugins are automatically configured for use with SSL.

SSL settings are applied equally across all machines in the cluster.

For more information about SSL support, see [https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html).

### <a id="erlang"></a>Erlang Cookie

You can provide an Erlang cookie to be used by the cluster.
This can be useful if you want to connect directly to the RabbitMQ cluster, such as with `rabbitmqctl`, or to connect other machines running Erlang.

<%= image_tag("images/config_erlang.jpeg") %>

### <a id="config"></a>RabbitMQ Config

You can provide a full <code>rabbitmq.config</code> file, if you wish.

<%= image_tag("images/config_rabbitmq.jpeg") %>

This file is then provided to all the nodes in the cluster.

For more information about the RabbitMQ configuration, see [https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html).

### <a id="tls"></a>TLS Support

TLS v1.0 is disabled by default, due to insecurities.

<%= image_tag("images/config_tls1.jpeg") %>

You can enable it again by selecting the checkbox.

TLS v1.1 and 1.2 are enabled by default and cannot be turned on or off.

## External load balancer
<%= image_tag("images/config_elb.jpeg") %>

You can configure a DNS name or IP address of an external load balancer to be returned in the binding credentials (`VCAP_SERVICES`) to application developers.

### <a id="static_ips"></a> Static IPs

#### Switching from dynamic IPs to static IPs (Upgrading)

It is not possible to switch from dynamic IPs to a different set of static IPs, but you can
set up Ops Manager so the current set of dynamically assigned IPs will always continue to be used.

1. Go to the Status page on the RabbitMQ product.
2. Note the IPs for the RabbitMQ Server and HAProxy for RabbitMQ jobs, in the order nodes appear in the UI.
3. Go to the Settings tab, and navigate to the Networking page.
4. Fill the IP addresses you got from the Status page. IP addresses should be in a comma-separated list.

<%= image_tag("images/config_static_ip.png") %>

## RabbitMQ Server settings that cannot be overwritten
* `rabbit halt_on_upgrade_failure false`
* `rabbitmq_mqtt subscription_ttl 1800000`
* `rabbit disk_free_limit 50MB`
* `log_levels [{connection,info}]`
* `halt_on_upgrade_failure false`
* `{rabbit, [ {collect_statistics_interval, 60000}] }`
* `{rabbitmq_management, [ {rates_mode, none}] }`

When SSL is enabled:

* `rabbit tcp_listeners []`
* `rabbit ssl_listeners [5671]`
* `rabbitmq_management listener [{port,15672},{ssl,false}]`
* `rabbitmq_mqtt ssl_listeners [8883]`
* `rabbitmq_stomp ssl_listeners [61614]`

## <a id='restart-stats'></a>Restarting Statistics Database

It is possible to setup a schedule to restart the statistics database following a cron schedule.  The schedule can be configured in the property _Restart RabbitMQ Statistics Database Schedule_ in the _RabbitMQ_cluster_configuration_ section.
The accepted format is the common cron expression (5 fields).

<%= image_tag("images/config_cron.png") %>

Examples:

* `* * * * *` will restart the database every minute (not suggested)
* `42 */3 * * * ` will restart the database every 3 hours at the minute 42 (e.g. 12:42, 15:42, 18:42)
* `0 0 * * MON-FRY` will restart the database at 00:00 on every day-of-week from Monday through Friday.

If the property is left empty no restart will be scheduled. Since this is an unvalidated input, incorrect cron formats will result in undesired behaviour.

## <a id="apply-changes"></a>Apply Configuration and Complete the Installation

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install RabbitMQ for PCF tile.

2. **Q:** How does one follow the progress of the tile, what to check? how long does it take?
