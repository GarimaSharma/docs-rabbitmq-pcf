# Changing Network and/or IP addresses
RabbitMQ for PCF requires that the IP addresses assigned to a `RabbitMQ Server` job do not change once assigned. The following
scenarios _will_ result in a new IP address being assigned, and subsequently, a failed upgrade deployment:

* Changing the `Network` or `Service Network` in the RabbitMQ tile's `Assign AZs and Networks` page.
* Changing the `Network` or `Service Network` definition such that the existing IP addresses are no longer
part of that network.

## Diagnosing
If, after a failed deployment, similar changes are present in the `Apply Changes` log, under `Detecting deployment changes`:
```
  networks:
  - name: ert-subnet
    subnets:
    - range: 10.16.64.0/22
      reserved:
+     - 10.16.64.62-10.16.64.65
+     - 10.16.64.182-10.16.64.196
-     - 10.16.64.120
-     - 10.16.64.185-10.16.64.196
      static:
+     - 10.16.64.120
-     - 10.16.64.62
-     - 10.16.64.63
-     - 10.16.64.64
-     - 10.16.64.65
```
Then it is likely that the IP addresses assigned to the `RabbitMQ Server` job have changed, causing the failed deployment.

## Recovering from a failed deployment
Please contact Pivotal Support if you have changed the IP address of a node.
