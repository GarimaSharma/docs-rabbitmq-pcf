## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.7.x version, upgrade to the latest v1.7.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.8.x version.

See the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf) for product versions and upgrade paths.

#### Known Issues

* Cluster scaling or changing the [Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang) value require cluster downtime,
  and might result in failed deployments.
  For more information, see [Cluster Scaling Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#scaling-issue) and 
[Changing the Erlang Cookie Value Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#changing-issue).

* Changing networks and/or IP addresses for the `RabbitMQ Server` job results in a failed deployment.
  For more information, see [Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment](./changing-ips.html).

* When errand run rules are set to **When Changed**, Ops Manager may not run the errands when the tile has relevant changes.
  For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/customizing/managing_errands.html).
  Pivotal recommends leaving the default run rule set to **On**.

* Certain special characters cannot be used with the RabbitMQ administrator password, and using them can lead to issues 
logging into the Management UI as that user.
