## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.12.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.12.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.13.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

Spring Cloud Services (SCS) should be aware that SCS will soon be dropping the
dependency on RabbitMQ. We therefore recommend SCS users do not upgrade to
RabbitMQ for PCF 1.13.

### <a id="1130"></a> v1.13.0

**Release Date**: XX

#### Features

* Ability to secure communication between apps and on-demand service instances using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
For more information, see [Preparing for TLS](./prepare-tls.html). For ease of
upgrade from previous versions, this functionality is turned off by default.

#### Notes
* Smoke tests for the on-demand broker now use the system org, as is already the case for multitenant.

#### Known Issues

* Cluster scaling or changing the [Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang) value require cluster downtime,
  and might result in failed deployments.
  For more information, see [Cluster Scaling Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#scaling-issue) and
[Changing the Erlang Cookie Value Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#changing-issue).

* Changing networks and/or IP addresses for the `RabbitMQ Server` job results in a failed deployment.
  For more information, see [Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment](./changing-ips.html).

* When errand run rules are set to **When Changed**, Ops Manager may not run the errands when the tile has relevant changes.
  For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/managing_errands.html).
  Pivotal recommends leaving the default run rule set to **On**.

#### Packages

* OSS RabbitMQ v3.7.6
* Erlang v20.3.8.1
* HAProxy v1.6.13
