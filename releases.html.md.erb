## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.11.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.11.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.12.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="use-rmq-3-7"></a> Delete existing On-Demand service instances running RabbitMQ v3.6

Only RabbitMQ v3.7 plans are available. Plans using RabbitMQ 3.6 have been removed.
Ensure that all instances running RabbitMQ 3.6 have been deleted before
upgrading to RabbitMQ For PCF 1.13. Deployment is expected to fail in case
there is any remaining on demand service instance running with RabbitMQ 3.6.

For more information, see the following:

+ [Check remaining On-Demand Instances](./upgrade.html#existing-ondemand-instances)
