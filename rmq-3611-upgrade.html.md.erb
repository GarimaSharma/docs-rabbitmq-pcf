## Overview

Upgrading to release 1.10.0 from earlier versions of RabbitMQ for PCF upgrades your RabbitMQ software to version 3.6.11. After this upgrade, RabbitMQ may report much higher memory usage than before due to a change in how nodes calculate the RAM they use. With this upgrade, the memory use is reported more accurately, whereas before the upgrade it was underreported.

Due to this change, you may have to increase the amount of memory allocated to the `RabbitMQ Server` job for each RabbitMQ server node. Follow the steps below to adjust the memory allocation if necessary.

### Changing the Memory Allocation

Prior to upgrading to this version, compare the memory
used by the RabbitMQ server nodes against the high watermark. You can see these figures in the RabbitMQ Management UI:

Here is a closer look at the memory use figures for the three nodes listed:

In the above image, the high watermark for each node is 6.0GB. The numbers in green represent the maximum memory used by each node at this particular time.

If the memory used by a node is more than 45% of the high watermark, you must increase the amount of memory allocated to the `RabbitMQ Server` job to avoid the risk of blocking publishers. Use the formula below to calculate the new memory allocation. The result must be applied to increase memory allocated on all nodes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**0.4m > 2.5n** 

where:

**m** is the new memory allocation for each node.<br> 
**n** is the highest value reported for maximum memory among any of the RabbitMQ nodes. 

For example, if you have three nodes and the one with the most memory used reports 4.8GB, then the value of **m** for each node is calculated as follows: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.5 × 4.8 = 12; 12/.4 = 30**

In the above example, each node should then be allocated a minimum of 30GB of RAM.

### Avoiding Paging to Disk

If the memory used is less than 45% of the high watermark, memory alarms
may be triggered after the upgrade, and it is likely that RabbitMQ will page out
certain queue contents to disk.  This is normal,
and is not a cause for concern. However, if you want to avoid
paging to disk, then increase the amount of memory allocated to each node's `RabbitMQ Server` job using the following formula: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**0.2m > 2.5n**

For more information on paging to disk, see the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#memsup-paging).
