## RabbitMQ management dashboard

To gain access to the management dashboard as the `admin` user, visit http://pivotal-rabbitmq.your.cf.installation.com

The username and password is the username and password you provided in the RabbitMQ configuration, which is also shown in the Credentials tab.

Users of Cloud Foundry who create instances via the developer web console, or the <code>cf</code> CLI also get access to the Management UI. This is done using credentials that provide access only to their particular <strong>vhost</strong>. The appropriate URL is accessible via the Manage button within the developer web console, but is also injected into the <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> environment variable provided to apps running on Cloud Foundry. This can also be found via the CLI using `cf env <your app name>`.
